TODO(): Time to implement the UI
1-10 25
tried to implement hot reloading :( not that sucessful but hey the filewatcher is working as expected 
WIll be using raygui for immediate mode graphics
2-10-15
change of plans for Gui
I will be using Dear ImGui with some glfw backend 
Raylib is to complicated for this project i might simply go for a win32 navtive stuff I get annoyed but combo but i dont think this will be the case
It takes me more time to make simple arch decision than writing the code very annoying at times 
But I intend to desing in a way that later api's are cleaner to work with 
I should not break after 6 months hence 
i think that good architecture is like having good pawn structure in a game of chess. The ideas in the position come more easily to one if structure is good otherwise its a lot of work

Made a basic ui in raylib 
now can perform a simple get request
Might change ui to some backend to something else current ram usage is 51 mb i want it below 10 mb
the size of exe is 1.6mb but libcurl for now is dyanmically linked add 5 to 6 mbs of that app is roun 7 to 8 mb
which isnt bad but this could be better if file pilot can be 1.8 mb why cant and take 7 mb of ram when running why cant this stuff be that
anyways
